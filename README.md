Game-Idea:

   Recently, I learned JS and JQuery. Then I wanted to practice it. So, I decided to develope one game model. And I searched a lot in google and finally I found one idea that is snake and ladder game. But its old idea. So, I made a small change in it. i.e, what if we played this game in space. 
   So decided to make a game like snake and ladder but instead of snake and ladder I'm used Teleport and Black-Hole.

Let's play this game and say me how is it.
